## Introduction <a name="introduction"/>

flake-pilot is a software to register, provision and launch applications
that are actually provided inside of a runtime environment like an
OCI container or a FireCracker VM. There are two main components:

1. The launchers

   The launcher binary. Each application that was registered as a
   flake is redirected to a launcher binary. As of today
   support for the ```podman``` and ```firecracker``` engines are
   implemented leading to the respective ```podman-pilot``` and
   ```firecracker-pilot``` launcher binaries.

2. The flake registration tool

   ```flake-ctl``` is the management utility to list, register,
   remove, and-more... flake applications on your host.

## Installation <a name="installation"/>

flake-pilot components are written in rust and available as packages
for SUSE ALP as follows:

```bash
zypper addrepo https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/marcus.schaefer:/EOS/ALP/
zypper install flake-pilot flake-pilot-podman flake-pilot-firecracker
```

Manual compilation and installation can be done as follows:

```bash
make build && make install
```

## Quick Start OCI containers <a name="oci"/>

As a start let's register an application named ```aws``` which is
connected to the ```aws-cli``` container provided by Amazon on
```docker.io/amazon```.

1. Pull the container

   ```bash
   flake-ctl podman pull --uri docker.io/amazon/aws-cli
   ```

2. Register the ```aws``` application

   ```bash
   flake-ctl podman register --container amazon/aws-cli --app /usr/bin/aws --target /
   ```

   This creates ```/usr/bin/aws``` on your host which actually
   launches the ```amazon/aws-cli``` container. The default entry
   point of the container was configured by Amazon to launch their
   cloud API application. Thus the target program to call inside
   of the container doesn't need to be explicitly configured in
   the registration and is therefore just set to ```/```

3. Launch the application

   To run ```aws``` just call for example:

   ```bash
   aws ec2 help
   ```

### Use Cases <a name="usecases"/>

Apart from this very simple example you can do a lot more. The main
idea for flake-pilot was not only to launch container based apps but
also allow to run a provision step prior calling the application.
This concept then allows for use cases like:

* delta containers used together with a base container such that
  only small delta containers gets pulled to the registry used with
  a base that exists only once.

* include arbitrary data without harming the host integrity e.g custom
  binaries, proprietary software not following package guidelines and
  standards, e.g automotive industry processes which we will not be
  able to change in this live ;)

* layering of several containers, e.g deltas on top of a base. Building
  up a solution stack e.g base + python + python-app.

* provisioning app dependencies from the host instead of providing them
  in the container, e.g a delta container providing the app using a base
  container but take the certificates or other sensitive information
  from the host; three way dependency model.

Actually all of the above use cases are immaterial if a proper packaging,
release and maintenance of the application is possible. However, I have
learned the world is not an ideal place and there might be a spot for
this project to be useful, supporting users with "special" needs and
adding an adaptive feature to the OS.

For demo purposes and to showcase the mentioned use cases, some
example images were created. See [How To Build Your Own App Images](#images)
for further details

## Quick Start FireCracker VMs <a name="fire"/>

Using containers to isolate applications from the host system is a common
approach. The limitation comes on the level of the kernel. Each container
shares the kernel with the host and if applications requires to run
privileged, requires direct access to device nodes or kernel interfaces
like the device mapper, a deeper level of isolation might be needed.
At this point full virtual system instances running its own kernel, optional
initrd and processes inside provides a solution. The price to pay is on
the performance side but projects like KVM and FireCracker offers a nice
concept to run virtual machines accelerated through KVM as competitive
alternative to containers. Thus flake-pilot also implements support for the
firecracker engine.

Start an application as virtual machine (VM) instance as follows:

1. Pull a firecracker compatible VM

   ```bash 
   flake-ctl firecracker pull --name leap \
       --kis-image https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/marcus.schaefer:/delta_containers/images_leap/firecracker-basesystem.$(uname -m).tar.xz
   ```

2. Register the ```mybash``` application
  
   ```bash
   flake-ctl firecracker register --vm leap \
       --app /usr/bin/mybash --target /bin/bash --overlay-size 20GiB
   ```

   This registers an app named ```mybash``` to the system. Once called a
   firecracker VM based on the pulled ```leap``` image is started and
   the ```/bin/bash``` program is called inside of the VM instance.
   In addition some write space of 20GB is added to the instance

3. Launch the application

   To run ```mybash``` just call for example:

   ```bash
   mybash
   ```

   Drops you into a bash shell inside of the VM

   **_NOTE:_** The data transfer from the virtual machine to the host
   is done through the serial console. As the process of calling the
   application includes the boot of the virtual machine, it might happen
   that kernel messages are intermixed with the output of the application.
   Our default setting prevents kernel messages from being printed to
   the console as much as possible but there are message that can hardly
   be prevented or requires a customized kernel build to be suppressed.
   As all messages are fetched from the serial console there is also
   no differentiation between **stdout** and **stderr** anymore.

### Use FireCracker VM image from components <a name="components"/>

In the quickstart for FireCracker a special image type called ```kis-image```
was used. This image type is specific to the KIWI appliance builder and
it provides the required components to boot up a FireCracker VM in one
archive. However, it's also possible to pull a FireCracker VM image from
its single components. Mandatory components are the kernel image and the
rootfs image, whereas the initrd is optional. The FireCracker project
itself provides its images in single components and you can use them
as follows:

1. Pull a firecracker compatible VM

   ```bash
   flake-ctl firecracker pull --name firecore \
       --rootfs https://s3.amazonaws.com/spec.ccfc.min/ci-artifacts/disks/x86_64/ubuntu-18.04.ext4 \
       --kernel https://s3.amazonaws.com/spec.ccfc.min/img/quickstart_guide/x86_64/kernels/vmlinux.bin
    ```

2. Register the ```fireshell``` application

   ```bash
   flake-ctl firecracker register \
       --app /usr/bin/fireshell --target /bin/bash --vm firecore --no-net
   ```

3. Launch the application

   To run ```fireshell``` just call for example:

   ```bash
   fireshell -c "'ls -l'"
   ```

### Networking <a name="networking"/>

As of today firecracker supports networking only through TUN/TAP devices.
As a consequence it is a user responsibility to setup the routing on the
host from the TUN/TAP device to the outside world. There are many possible
solutions available and the following describes a simple static IP and NAT
based setup.

The proposed example works within the following requirements:

* initrd_path must be set in the flake configuration
* The used initrd has to provide support for systemd-(networkd, resolved)
  and must have been created by dracut such that the passed
  boot_args in the flake setup will become effective

1. Enable IP forwarding

   ```bash 
   sudo sh -c "echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward"
   ```

2. Setup NAT on the outgoing interface

   Network Address Translation(NAT) is an easy way to route traffic
   to the outside world even when it originates from another network.
   All traffic looks like if it would come from the outgoing interface
   though. In this example we assume ```eth0``` to be the outgoing
   interface:

   ```bash
   sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
   sudo iptables -A FORWARD -m conntrack --ctstate RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
   ```

3. Setup network configuration in the flake setup

   The flake configuration for the registered ```mybash``` app from
   above can be found at:

   ```bash
   vi /usr/share/flakes/mybash.yaml
   ```

   The default network setup is based on DHCP because this is
   the only generic setting that flake-ctl offers at the moment.
   The setup offered for networking provides the setting
   ```ip=dhcp```. Change this setting to the following:

   ```yaml
   vm:
     runtime:
       firecracker:
         boot_args:
           - ip=172.16.0.2::172.16.0.1:255.255.255.0::eth0:off
           - rd.route=172.16.0.1/24::eth0
           - nameserver=8.8.8.8
   ```

   In this example the DHCP based setup changes to a static
   IP: 172.16.0.2 using 172.16.0.1 as its gateway and Google
   to perform name resolution. Please note: The name of the
   network interface in the guest is always ```eth0```. For
   further information about network setup options refer
   to ```man dracut.cmdline``` and lookup the section
   about ```ip=```

4. Create a tap device matching the app registration. In the above example
   the app ```/usr/bin/mybash``` was registered. The firecracker pilot
   configures the VM instance to pass trafic on the tap device name
   ```tap-mybash```. If the application is called with an identifier like
   ```mybash @id```, the tap device name ```tap-mybash@id``` is used.

   ```bash
   sudo ip tuntap add tap-mybash mode tap
   ```

   **_NOTE:_** If the tap device does not exist, firecracker-pilot will
   create it for you. However, this might be too late in case of e.g a
   DHCP setup which requires the routing of the tap device to be present
   before the actual network setup inside of the guest takes place.
   If firecracker-pilot creates the tap device it will also be
   removed if the instance shuts down.

5. Connect the tap device to the outgoing interface

   Select a subnet range for the tap and bring it up

   **_NOTE:_** The settings here must match with the flake configuration !

   ```bash
   ip addr add 172.16.0.1/24 dev tap-mybash
   ip link set tap-mybash up
   ```

   Forward tap to the outgoing interface

   ```bash
   sudo iptables -A FORWARD -i tap-mybash -o eth0 -j ACCEPT
   ```

6. Start the application

   ```bash
   mybash

   $ ip a
   $ ping www.google.de
   ```

   **_NOTE:_** The tap device cannot be shared across multiple instances.
   Each instance needs its own tap device. Thus the steps 3,4 and 5 needs
   to be repeated for each instance.

## Application Setup <a name="setup"/>

After the registration of an application they can be listed via

```bash
flake-ctl list
```

Each application provides a configuration below ```/usr/share/flakes/```.
The term ```flake``` is a short name that we came up with to provide
a generic name for an application running inside of an isolated environment.
For our above registered ```aws``` flake the config file structure
looks like the following:

```
/usr/share/flakes/
├── aws.d
└── aws.yaml
```

Please consult the manual pages for detailed information 
about the contents of the flake setup.

## How To Build Your Own App Images <a name="images"/>

Building images as container- or VM images can be done in different ways.
One option is to use the **Open Build Service** which is able to build
software packages and images and therefore allows to maintain the
complete application stack. 

For demo purposes and to showcase the mentioned <a name="usecases"/>
some example images were created and could be considered as a simple
```flake store```. Please find them here:

* https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/home:marcus.schaefer:delta_containers

Feel free to browse through the project and have some fun testing. There
is a short description in each application build how to use them.

**_NOTE:_** All images are build using the
[KIWI](https://github.com/OSInside/kiwi) appliance builder which is
supported by the Open Build Service backend and allows to build all the
images in a maintainable way. KIWI uses an image description format
to describe the image in a declarative way. Reading the above
examples should give you an idea how things fits together. In case
of questions regarding KIWI and the image builds please don't hesitate
to get in contact with us.

Flake pilot is a project in its early stages and the result of
a fun conversation over beer on a conference. Feedback
is very much welcome.

Remember to have fun :)
