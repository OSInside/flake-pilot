FLAKE-PILOT(8)
==============

DESCRIPTION
-----------

flake-pilot is a software to register, provision and launch
applications that are actually provided inside of a runtime
environment like an OCI container or a FireCracker VM. Along
with the project a collection of application launchers is
provided which are called `pilots`. For details on the different
pilots see:

- man podman-pilot
- man firecracker-pilot

The flake registration tool `flake-ctl` is the management utility
to list, register, remove, and-more... flake applications
on your host. For details about flake-ctl see:

- man flake-ctl
